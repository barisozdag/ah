A responsive Plex plugin web frontend

[:books: Read the full add-on documentation][docs]

## About

[Kitana][kitana] exposes your Plex plugin interfaces "to the outside world". It
does that by authenticating against Plex.TV, then connecting to the Plex Media
Server you tell it to, and essentially proxying the plugin UI. It has full PMS
connection awareness and allows you to connect locally, remotely, or even via
relay.

## Support

Got questions?

You could [open an issue here][issue] GitHub.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. I'm always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:
